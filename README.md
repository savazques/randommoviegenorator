# randommoviegenorator

Hi, I am still a fairly new coder and still learning the fundamentls and more basic concepts. 

In this project I wanted to develop a random movie genorator that would scrap data from the internet. In the soup.py file I learned beautifulsoup4 that
allowed a set of commands to access a website and scrape data based on the html tags. The soupmovie.py would also create a csv file that contained all of the info 
about the movie. The moviegenerator.py would then open the csv file and would generate a random movie, based on the user input.
